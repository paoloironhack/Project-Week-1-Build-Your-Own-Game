## Project Description
In the one player Memory game, several images are covered up by white boxes. There are two of each image. The player can click on two boxes to see what image is behind them. If the icons match, then those boxes remain uncovered. The player wins when all the boxes on the board are uncovered. 


## Rules
1. Click on any one of the white boxes and uncover the image.
2. Once you see the image, remember and try finding the same image in another box.
3. Once you find the pair, you win the turn. 
4. Now continue uncovering the other white boxes and find its identical pair.
5. After you uncover all the white boxes, you win!
